# Summary

The global economy is evolving with technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, distributed ledgers, and modern banking systems. This work introduces **@mo**, a new fungible digital currency designed for secure transactions of intangible assets (such as goodwill, reputation, or digital tokens) in fields like healthcare and humanitarian aid. Using a **Proof of Concept (PoC)**, the paper demonstrates enhanced transaction security and stability by combining **quantum encryption**, **AI-driven cybersecurity**, **blockchain protocols**, and **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to optimize transaction paths and reduce currency volatility.

# Statement of Need

Traditional currencies struggle to represent and manage intangible assets. The @mo currency addresses this gap by providing a secure, efficient, and ethical method for exchanging digital intangible assets, ensuring trustworthiness and stability in volatile environments where traditional money systems fall short.

# Software Description

## Key Features (Version 1.0.0)

- Use of Dijkstra's Algorithm to optimize transfer routes

*Note: Other features like secure onboarding, digital wallet management, inheritance plans, encrypted data messaging, secure storage, revocation system, security audits, and quantum-proofing are planned for future versions.*

## Technologies Used (Version 1.0.0)

- Python

*Note: Technologies like Power BI, blockchain-based storage, quantum encryption, and AI algorithms are planned for future versions.*

## Architecture

Users manage assets through SafeID accounts linked to mobile and cold storage solutions, with smart protection plans ensuring secure, automated asset transfer.
