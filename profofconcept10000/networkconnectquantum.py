# Bridge-Embedded Block Diagonal Merge (BEBDiM) 
# In order to interconnect 2 payment networks, the following process is innovated. This process is named "Bridge-Embedded Block Diagonal Merge"
# A block matrix composition, is specifically a type of block diagonal concatenation or matrix embedding.
# Operation: Block Matrix Construction / Embedding also named 'Bridge-Embedded Block Diagonal Merge'.
# Block Diagonal Merge: It means that you are performing a block diagonal embedding of two square matrices (A and B) into a larger square matrix.
# Bridge Embedding: It means that you then explicitly connect the two sub-networks by adding a "bridge" element 
# (e.g., a 1) between a node in A and a node in B ‚Äî in this case, at position (0, a) ‚Äî effectively simulating inter-network connectivity
# If you have two matrices A and B, and you want to place A in the top-left corner and B in the bottom-right corner of a new, larger matrix ‚Äî with zeros elsewhere
# ‚Äî you're constructing a block diagonal matrix (with one block in each corner).
# Example
# Let:
# A be a matrix of shape (m, n)
# B be a matrix of shape (p, q)
# Then the resulting matrix C will have shape (m + p, n + q), and look like this:
# C=[A 0]
#   [0 B]
# Where 0 represents zero matrices of appropriate dimensions to fill the rest of the space.
# In addition, in order to connect the 2 networks for instance the firts items of each network need to be connected (e.g. this is managed by the merge authority)

# The goal is to build a square matrix D such that:
# Matrix A (shape (a, a)) is placed in the top-left
# Matrix B (shape (b, b)) is placed in the bottom-right
# The full matrix is of shape (a + b, a + b)
# Zeros fill the rest
# Then set the element at position (0, a) (i.e., just right of the last column of A, in the first row) to 1
# example:
#[[ 1.  2.  1.  0.  0.]
# [ 3.  4.  0.  0.  0.]
# [ 0.  0.  5.  6.  7.]
# [ 0.  0.  8.  9. 10.]
# [ 0.  0. 11. 12. 13.]]

# Post-Quantum Encryption Flow
# This flow encrypts the names in node_namesD using encrypt_message and decrypt_message functions located in quantum.py
# This code combines PyCryptodome (for AES encryption) with a post-quantum key exchange using quantcrypt,
# so you get a full quantum-safe encryption flow
